# 0x03. Responsive design

#### Introduction
Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. It emphasizes providing an optimal viewing experience across a range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Mobile-first design**: This approach involves designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up to larger screens. It ensures that the website functions well and looks good on smaller screens, and then additional features or styles can be added for larger screens.

2. **Media queries**: Media queries are CSS techniques used to apply different styles depending on the characteristics of the device or browser. They allow developers to create responsive designs by targeting specific device features such as screen width, height, orientation, and resolution.

3. **Sizes to use for responsive web design**: Common sizes used in responsive web design include percentages, em units, and viewport units such as vw (viewport width) and vh (viewport height). These units allow elements to adapt dynamically to the size of the viewport, making them flexible and responsive.

4. **How to make a website responsive**: To make a website responsive, developers can follow best practices such as using fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. They should also prioritize content and optimize performance for mobile devices.

5. **Differences between responsive and adaptive design**: Responsive design uses fluid grids and media queries to adapt the layout based on the screen size, while adaptive design uses predefined layouts for different screen sizes. Responsive design offers a more flexible and fluid approach, while adaptive design provides more precise control over the layout on different devices.

6. **CSS units for flexible elements**: CSS units such as percentages, em, rem, and viewport units (vw, vh, vmin, vmax) are commonly used to make elements flexible and responsive. These units allow developers to define sizes relative to the viewport or parent elements, making designs adaptable to different screen sizes.
